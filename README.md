<h2 align="center">A little about myself</h2>

<h6>I've loved technology since I was a little girl, but it was about taking things apart, understanding how they work. I tried to take a computer course at the age of 10, but they thought I was too young at the time, and with that they didn't want to teach me anymore. But I still didn't let that stop me, so I didn't stop there. When I was a teenager, I used Tumblr, and with that, sometimes I needed to create codes or modify some things to make or use themes, I didn't relate it to programming, but it was my beginning, and I realize it now.</h6>

<h6>However, in 2021, while completing the Bachelor of Nursing course, I decided to try some selective processes within the faculty related to the technology area, and this made my vision for possibility become much greater. I learned a bit of programming, design, mechanics, electronics, and several other things. And as I was finishing college in 2022, I started to participate in competitions, I participated in hackathons, game jams, e-games selective, participating remotely, mainly, which gave me the possibility to know the whole world from home, since I was able to participate in hackathons in the US, Canada, India, UK, and of course, Brazil.</h6>

<h6>They thought I was crazy, how could I participate in international competitions if I barely knew another language? But that's exactly why I'm currently learning English and Spanish. They thought I was crazy, how could I participate in international competitions if I barely knew another language? But that's exactly why I'm currently learning English and Spanish. But despite having participated in so many things, which made me acquire so much knowledge, I still need to improve some, and that's why I use this GitHub for study and competition projects, selection processes and the like, and <a href="https://github.com/SouCodigo">SouCodigo</a> for projects I want to develop.</h6>
